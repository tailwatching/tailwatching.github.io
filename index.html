                                            <p>For a long time, systematic investing has been the exclusive domain of Wall Street whales. Hedge funds, armed with vast resources, employ teams of data scientists, analysts and PhDs to unlock alpha - The edge that generates consistent market outperformance. This leaves retail investors at a disadvantage, unable to access the sophisticated tools and insights needed to compete.

                                            <b>Tail Watching</b> is a long-only, trend following model (i.e. Buy positions in trending assets).

                                            Traditional portfolio strategies follow the idea that asset prices follow a normal distribution. However, the existence of fat tails suggests that asset returns are not normally distributed, but skewed.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                            The fat tails indicate that there is a probability (often larger than anticipated), that prices will move beyond 3 standard deviations. The Tail Watching model capitalizes on these tails in trending liquid markets to generate outsized returns.
